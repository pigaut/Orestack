# Description: Let's say we have a special block that we want all our players
# to be able to gather, but we don't want players to camp and hoard the resource.
# We can use flags and the scripting system to create a cooldown.

--- # ===== Stage 1 =====
type: depleted
block: bedrock
growth: 2s

--- # ===== Stage 2 =====
type: regrown
block: lodestone

on-break:
    # Check if the player who mined the block is on cooldown
  - if: hasFlag lodestone_cooldown
    # If he is, send an error message, cancel the block break, and end code execution
    do:
      - chatMessage <&4You must wait 4 seconds to mine another lodestone>
      - cancelEvent
      - return

    # Otherwise, give the player the cooldown flag
  - do: giveFlag lodestone_cooldown

    # And remove it after the desired period of time
  - delay: 80
    do: takeFlag lodestone_cooldown

    # This is one example on how to use flags,
    # just remember that flags are not saved when
    # a player quits the game
